      MyShkefet is a project developed as part of the Science-Engineering program at MetroWest High-school in Raanana. We're 
      a group of three students- Elazar Hirsch, Iftah Houry, and Tal Minay - who are working together to make swimming the 
      best experience possible. The MyShkefet system allows you to measure your swim data during your workout, view it as you
      swim in our unique heads-up display, and upload your swim for analysis on this website to see swim data over time. To 
      contact us, email gogglemetro@gmail.com or call 03-610-9898. Thanks!
